# Paraphrased from: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/matrix-script/problem
#
# Neo has a complex matrix script consisting of an N Ã— M grid of strings.  It
# consists of alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the symbols !, @,#, $, %, &
# 
# To decode the script, Neo needs to read each column and select only the
# alphanumeric characters and connect them.  Neo reads the column from top to
# bottom and starts reading from the leftmost column.
# 
# If there are symbols or spaces between two alphanumeric characters of the 
# decoded script, then Neo replaces them with a single space ' ' for better
# readability.
# 
# Neo feels that there is no need to use 'if' conditions for decoding.
# 
# Alphanumeric characters consist of [A-Za-z0-9].
# 
# The input will consist of a line containing space separated integers N and M
# followed by N lines containing M characters each, these are the rows.
# 
# Constraints:
# N > 0
# M < 100
# 
# Sample Input:
# ```
# 7 3
# Tsi
# h%x
# i #
# sM 
# $a 
# #t%
# ir!
# ```
# 
# Sample Output:
# ```
# This is Matrix# %!
# ```

        # It'll be easiest to first read our matrix column-wise and concatenate
        # the columns into a single string.  Once we do that, decoding becomes
        # trivial.
        #
        # Admittedly it would be slightly more efficient to only pass over the
        # matrix once and decode on the spot, but we're restricted to not using
        # conditionals.

        # At first I decided to read the matrix column-wise by using a nested
        # loop going through all rows for each column.  It looked like this:
        #
        # ```

        #
        # This solution is the most readable, so I'm continuing to use it.
        # However, a perhaps cooler way to achieve the same column-wise reading
        # of the matrix uses zip.
        #
        # If you play around with zip a bit then you can note that:
        # >>> zip(*[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
        # [(1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 6)]
        #
        # So, a column-wise reading of the matrix could just as easily be
        # written as:
        #
        # ```
        # encoded_string = ''.join(''.join(col) for col in zip(*matrix))
        # ```
        # where you first join the characters in the column, then you join the
        # columns together.
        #
        # Note that this is far less readable, so I stuck with my original

        # and what regex defines as part of \w
        w = r"[A-Za-z0-9]"

        # I don't want to capture the {w} before and after the spaces/symbols,
        # so this looks like another case for lookarounds.
