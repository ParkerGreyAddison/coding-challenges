# coding-challenges
A collection of completed coding challenges from sources like LeetCode and HackerRank.  I don't wish to spoil anyone's fun, so please do not continue any further if you're just looking for a quick solution.

That being said, if you want to get a sense for how I think about a problem, I generally end up commenting my entire internal narrative when I work on problems.  So, feel completely free to take a look at ways that our though process may differ, and feel free to contact me if there's a cooler way to do something!
